<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

My absolute favourite videogame of all time is Persona 3 Portable for the hit handheld console the Playstation Portable, I first played the game sometime around 2011-ish and fell in love with the social sim element of the game, I had never seen anything like it.

The process of upgrading your stats through activities was addictive to me, and watching the spider chart max out each attribute was so satifying. I've wanted to create something similar for personal use, this will be my attempt, and what better way to learn a new language than with a lightweight and personal project.
